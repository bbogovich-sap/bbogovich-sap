## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a Development Expert and late night architect at SAP.  My current focus is on front end development for the [Integrated Business Planning](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/integrated-business-planning.html) [Planner Workspaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATED_BUSINESS_PLANNING/abee3923ad4d4722b6f10b0fe6cf4cef/a50e56af46384e7a83e7ad49877e518b.html?version=2508) platform.

The majority of my career has been full-stack development, but with a decided preference for user interface design and implementation.  I have an on again, off again participation in UX design, but with the current scope of work have not had the time to invest in that role recently.

Outside of SAP, I'm a photographer, occasional indie filmmaker, short fiction writer, and always learning something new in the visual arts.  For a few misguided years I was a perfomer with two local opera companies (I was young, I needed the money).  More recently I've been working on improving my woodworking skills to build a new home office.
